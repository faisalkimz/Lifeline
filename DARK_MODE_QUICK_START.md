## 4️⃣ Better Language

Instead of AI-sounding copy, we now have:

| Old (AI-ish) | New (Human) |
|---|---|
| "Welcome back, [Name]! Here's your company's HR dashboard at a glance." | "Hey [Name]! 👋 Here's what's going on with your team." |
| "Top Managers by Team Size" | "Team Leaders" |
| "Direct Reports" | "Reports" |
| "Employment Status" | "Status" |
| "No managers found. Add one to get started!" | "No team leaders yet. Promote an employee to get started." |
| "Recently added employees" | "New Hires" |
| "Upcoming Birthdays & Anniversaries" | "Coming Up" |

## ✨ The "Human" Touch

No more robot-sounding copy like:
- "Here's what's happening at your company today"
- "HR dashboard at a glance"
- "Manage organizational hierarchy and reporting relationships"

Now we say things like:
- "Here's what's going on with your team"
- "Team Leaders"  
- "Promote an employee to get started"

Feels way more natural! 👍
